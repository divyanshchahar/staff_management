## How to run locally

This project was initialized as a yarn monorepo and contains two workspaces named client and server. For the purpose of this project only client workspace is used as no server side functionality was required.

<br>

To run the project use the following command in project root

<br>

```
yarn dev
```

<br>

> The client workspace was setup using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) <br> By default the project should run on [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/), however if that port is occupied, the port number will be printed in the console by vite.
